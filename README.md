This project is using JIRA tool for project management and defect traking following agile methodology SCRUM.


## TEST STRATEGY
This project adopts BDD Methodology for testing.

1. Functional test scenarios are defined for each user story before development using the Gherkin language, facilitated by an Integrated Test Management Tool for Jira.

2. Functional test scenarios are executed manually on both Desktop and Mobile platforms for each user story. Any encountered bugs are promptly logged on JIRA and linked to the respective user story and test scenario. Test results are documented using test Management Tool.

3. Regression test scenarios are automated using Cypress and Cucumber, and run after each change through continuous integration with GitHub Actions.
